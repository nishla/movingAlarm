### Project Description
This project is a fun and interactive Python-based alarm clock that makes waking up a challenge. When the alarm rings, a "Stop" button moves randomly across the screen, forcing the user to catch it to stop the sound. It helps prevent oversleeping by requiring physical interaction.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Many people tend to turn off their alarms and fall back asleep, especially when the stop button is easy to press. Traditional alarms don‚Äôt provide enough interaction to fully wake the user up, leading to oversleeping and missed responsibilities.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This project solves the problem by creating a Python-based alarm clock with a randomly moving ‚ÄúStop‚Äù button. When the alarm rings, the user must physically chase and click the moving button, making it harder to snooze and encouraging full wakefulness through active interaction.
